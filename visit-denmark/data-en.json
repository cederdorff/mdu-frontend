In some places the clay soil of the slopes has fallen down so that the trees lean towards the water.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Well-preserved trees and nature life</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Around 1820 the forests were badly overcut. Therefore the present trees have practically all been planted after this period. However, some conifers have been planted in this century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>200-300 year old beech trees&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Spread around&nbsp;the forests, especially in Moesg&aring;rd&nbsp;Skov you will find a few 200-300 year old beech trees which have been preserved for aesthetic reasons. Today they are the breeding place for some species of birds brooding in caves.</p>\r\n<h3>Ourdoor&nbsp;activities</h3>\r\n<p>The Marselisborg forest is one of Denmark&rsquo;s most frequently visited nature resorts and is used for an endless list of ourdoor activities such as running and cycling events. Despite the forest&rsquo;s rugged terrain, it is very well-suited for hiking, just as horseback riders come in large numbers, as the forest has marked off riding trails.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, a 25 km mountainbike trail runs through the forest, and the mix of flat grit-paths and steep hills and descends adds to the diversity along the way and makes for a great experience for everyone.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus/see-and-do/hiking-and-running\" target=\"_blank\">Walking and running routes in Aarhus</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=\"#marselisborgskovene\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/marselisborgskovene/?hl=da\" target=\"_blank\">#marselisborgskovene</a>&nbsp;<a title=\"VisitAarhus\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt0s3JKjpre/\" target=\"_blank\">#visitaarhus</a>&nbsp;<a title=\"#visitaarhusregionen\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/visitaarhusregionen/?hl=da\" target=\"_blank\">#visitaarhusregion</a></p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":28,"DescriptionType":"Html meta tag title","Text":"Marselisborg Forests | VisitAarhus","Html":"<p>Marselisborg&nbsp;Forests | VisitAarhus</p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":29,"DescriptionType":"Html meta tag description","Text":"Enjoy the nature and the 200-300 years old beech trees when you visit the Marselisborg Forests with your family, friends, dog or when you want to enjoy a hike alone through the dense forests.","Html":"<p>Enjoy the nature and the 200-300 years old beech trees when you visit the Marselisborg&nbsp;Forests with your family, friends, dog or when you want to enjoy a hike alone through the dense forests.</p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":30,"DescriptionType":"Html meta tags","Text":"Marselisborg forests, danish nature, beeches in denmark, hike, forest","Html":"<p>Marselisborg forests, danish&nbsp;nature, beeches in denmark, hike, forest</p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":32,"DescriptionType":"INTROTEKST","Text":"South of Aarhus a forest belt streches 7 kilometres along the coast.

been on everyone's lips - for better or worse. In 2020 the ambitious restaurant group DiningSix took over the burger chain, and now Burger Shack is back in top form.\n\nExciting \"Shack menus\"\n\nYou have the option to choose from seven different \"Shack menus\". There is something for everyone. The menu includes the aforementioned \"Shack Fries\", topped with Italian cheese and thyme. Burger Shack uses 100% Danish beef from Danish farmers and 100% Danish chicken.\n\nDelicious vegan burger\n\nMaybe you are vegan or maybe you just don’t eat meat. It’s not a problem. Burger Shack serves a vegan burger menu. The plant steak is made from pea protein and in the vegan brioche burger bun you will also find vegan cheddar and vegan mayo.\n\nChildren's universe\n\nThe young visitors to the burger restaurant get a small gift to take home. The menu has a small book about Jack and all of his adventures.

The exhibition will be an annual recurring event that puts Aarhus on the map with a high quality art fair.</p>\r\n<h3>Great music and wonderful surroundings</h3>\r\n<p>The fair takes place in the Raw Hall (R&aring; Hal) of Godsbanen, which has a raw and industrial expression that also compliment the art with its natural light. The exhibition walls are divided so that the stands are partly open on several sides. It gives a more gallery feel as you move around and visitors are inspired to explore the stands and art in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Works Art Fair p&aring; Instagram\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/worksartfair/\" target=\"_blank\">#worksartfair</a>&nbsp;<a title=\"VisitAarhus p&aring; Instagram\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/visitaarhus/\" target=\"_blank\">#visitaarhus</a>&nbsp;<a title=\"VisitAarhusRegion Tag\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/visitaarhusregion/\" target=\"_blank\">#visitaarhusregion</a></p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":28,"DescriptionType":"Html meta tag title","Text":"Works Art Fair | VisitAarhus","Html":"<p>Works Art Fair | VisitAarhus</p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":29,"DescriptionType":"Html meta tag description","Text":"At Works Art Fair in Aarhus, you can experience art from over 60 established or up-and-coming artists working with many different materials - glass, ceramics, canvas, photographs and much more.","Html":"<p>At Works Art Fair in Aarhus, you can experience art from over 60 established or up-and-coming artists working with many different materials - glass, ceramics, canvas, photographs and much more.</p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":30,"DescriptionType":"Html meta tags","Text":"works art fair, art fair, gallery, art","Html":"<p>works art fair, art fair, gallery, art</p>"},{"DescriptionTypeID":32,"DescriptionType":"INTROTEKST","Text":"Works Art Fair is a new ambitious art fair in Aarhus focusing on original works of art, sculpture, glass art, ceramics, graphics and photo art.

The highly distinctive tower has changed the Aarhus skyline noticeably.\n\nThere are two ways that you can take the ‘jump’. The daring can take the free fall from the top and reach 5G acceleration. Or you can sit and enjoy the views while descending slowly and steadily, going round the tower all the way up and down.\n\nThe stinging Cobra\n\nHave you got nerves of steel?

This is certainly not for the faint-hearted. This is only for those with nerves of steel who are literally not afraid to leap into wild adventures. Standing 40 meters above the ground, overlooking all of Aarhus, it is only the toughest of the tough who dare take the leap. Before you awaits the maddest free fall, where you reach a speed of up to 90 kilometres per hour before landing in the net. Only one question remains: Do you dare?\n\n'Himmelrum'\n\nGet ready to spin and twirl if you want to try the new amusement 'Himmelrum'. The amusement allows you to defy gravity and forget time as it makes you feel alive! \n\nFor the youngest one\n\nBille By is an entire town for families with young children. Here you can take you very own driving license if you are between 5 and 8 years old and drive around in small electric cars. You can also take a breathtaking ride with \"Bisværmen\" which turns and twirls or try the ever-jumping Grasshopper.
